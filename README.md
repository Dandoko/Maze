# Maze Craze

## Overview

This is maze generator and solver built in Visual Studio with C++. The purpose
of the program is to learn procedural generation and pathfinding algorithms.
The current method of approach for learning the algorithms has been reading
brief descriptions about the algorithms and translating the pseudocode into the
project.

**This project is a work in progress.**

## Implemented Algorithms

### Procedural Generation

- Randomized DFS (Recursive Backtracker)
- Randomized Prim's Algorithm
- Wilson's Algorithm
- Recursive Division - **Work in Progress**

### Pathfinding

- Coming Soon

## Limitations

- This program will only run on a Windows operating system
